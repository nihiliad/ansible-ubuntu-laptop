## Installation Notes

* On the ThinkPad X1 Extreme, had to disable Secure Boot, otherwise booting from a flash drive would fail, with the message `(initramfs) unable to find a live medium containing a live file system`.
* Installed Lenovo BIOS version 1.17. (Provide more details!)
* LastPass extension would not install on Firefox (login form would close whenever I clicked on the password field), so installed `chromium-browser`, on which install was successful.
* Installed Google Chrome for UMN apps. (Provide more details!)
* Installed direnv.
